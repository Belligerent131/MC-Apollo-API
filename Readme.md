## Getting Started

Clone this repository, run `yarn` in the root directory.
Run `yarn start` to populate node_module dependancies
navigate to `http://localhost:4000/graphql`

This project uses ORM to generate database models and uses GraphQL to handle API's.
With ORM we have to ability to swap out any type of database including: sqlite, mongodb, mssql, postgres, MySQL, etc...

All database models are in entity folder, the GraphQL introspection schema is autogenerated from the Entity models. And then GraphQL Resolvers are in the Resolver folder.

I can walk anyone through the process. It is very simple to create API's with GraphQL, and takes only a few minutes to learn.

Check out the McServer entity and resolver for getting started comments!
